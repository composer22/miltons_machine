This library of Ruby code is primarily dedicated to the analysis and "practical" application of set theory for musical
composition - as defined in the various contexts of 12 tone theory and its offshoots (e.g. Forte, Morris, Starr,
Lewin, Cohn, etc.).  Additional features and functions from other theoretics will be provided from time to time to
supplement this basis.

"Milton", in the title, refers to the theorist and American composer Milton Byron Babbitt to which this project
is dedicated to (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Babbitt)
